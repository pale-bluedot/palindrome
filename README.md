### Description

Inspired by the time bending film `Tenet` I wrote this program to check for palindrome words. A `palindrome` is a word, number, or a phrase that reads the same forwards as backward.

#### Function: `checkPalindrome`

The user will input a string (spaces allowed) and the function will return true if it is a palindrome or false if it is not a palindrome.

#### Examples:

- tenet
- kayak
- 1001
- Was it a car or a cat I saw?
- ABBA
